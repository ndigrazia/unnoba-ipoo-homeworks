#Default Methods

Before Java 8, interfaces could have only abstract methods. The implementation of these methods has to be provided in a separate class. So, if a new method is to be added in an interface, then its implementation code has to be provided in the class implementing the same interface. To overcome this issue, Java 8 has introduced the concept of default methods which allow the interfaces to have methods with implementation without affecting the classes that implement the interface.

interface TestInterface 
{ 
    // abstract method 
    public void square(int a); 
  
    // default method 
    default void show() 
    { 
      System.out.println("Default Method Executed"); 
    } 
} 
  
class TestClass implements TestInterface 
{ 
    // implementation of square abstract method 
    public void square(int a) 
    { 
        System.out.println(a*a); 
    } 
  
    public static void main(String args[]) 
    { 
        TestClass d = new TestClass(); 
        d.square(4); 
  
        // default method executed 
        d.show(); 
    } 
}
